1. Guard programming is based on the idea of adding a guard which is a boolean expression that must first evaluate to true before a program can continue to execute. However, to be more precise, it usually adds a clause that would allow or disallow sections of code to run based on preconditions. 
2. NextJS is a framework that enables React web applications with server-side rendering and also to generate static websites. NextJS helps with the problem of web application that is rendered in the client's browser with Javascript by allowing some or all of the website to be rendered on the server-side before being sent to the client. When you try to inspect a website done in ReactJS you will see javascript but when you inspect NextJs you will see html code.
3. ReactJS is a Javascript library and it is used for frontend and NodeJS uses Javascript on the server environment and also can generate dynamic page while NextJS uses server-side rendering and generates static websites
4. API is an acronym that stands for "Application Programming Interface", In our understanding API is the middleman that helps frontend to communicate with the backend.
5. Typescript is a strongly typed programming language that is built on top of Javascript. It is very useful because in Javascript most of the errors are caught during the run time but if you use Typescript it will detect the errors/bugs before run time or rather in compile time because it has type checking. Typescript is also built on top of JavaScript so everything in TypeScript is a valid JavaScript code. It's benefits are as compared to JavaScript which is dynamically typed it is instead statically typed which means at compile time if the type is not annotated it would automatically produce an error which is useful for medium to large projects.
