1. Guard programming is based on the idea of adding a guard which is a boolean expression that must first evaluate to true before a program can continue to execute. However, to be more precise, it usually adds a clause that would allow or disallow sections of code to run based on preconditions.

5. Typescript is a strongly typed programming language that is built on top of Javascript. It is very useful because in Javascript most of the errors are caught during the run time but if you use Typescript it will detect the errors/bugs before run time or rather in compile time because it has type checking. Typescript is also built on top of JavaScript so everything in TypeScript is a valid JavaScript code. It's benefits are as compared to JavaScript which is dynamically typed it is instead statically typed which means at compile time if the type is not annotated it would automatically produce an error which is useful for medium to large projects.
